👋 Hi, I’m @moritzzoepffel.
👀 I'm interested in all kinds of programming tasks.
🔬 I'm especially intrigued by data: data science, data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
🌱 I'm currently deepening my skills in Python, as well as in data science and data analytics in my masters.
🚀 I look forward to working on challenging projects that have the potential to revolutionize the way we handle and derive insights from data.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects focusing on machine learning, artificial intelligence, or any other data-centric subjects.
📚 In my free time, I love continuously learning and keeping myself updated about the latest trends in the AI and data science world.
